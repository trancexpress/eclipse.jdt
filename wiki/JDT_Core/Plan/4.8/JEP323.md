# Planning page for JDT Implementation of Local Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters (JEP 323) for Java 11

Main tracking bug: To Create

## Compiler changes

Changes regarding the compiler:

### Grammar changes

Local Variable syntax is already supported in 18.3 via [JEP 286
Support](https://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php?title=JDT_Core/Plan/4.8/JEP286).
Expecting that the addition of var keyword may not be a big issue for
lambda parameters - hopefully no conflicts - to check. effort/time
estimate for grammar for around a week (assuming conflicts)

### Type checking

  - Determine the type of the var declaration - This should not be an
    issue since the type is already inferred of type-elided lambda
    parameters. - still giving a couple of days to iron out issues, if
    any.

### Error reports

  - similar to type-elided params.

### Code generation

Shouldn't be much work since the code gen will not be different from
existing ones.

## Java Search support

no change expected.

## DOM support

no change expected.

## Content Assist support

  - option of providing var at lambda -(2d?)

## UI Changes

  - Switch ASTs to JLS11 (generic - 1d)

### Code hover

  - Show inferred type of variable - no change expected

### Preferences

  - Allow JDT UI to target Java 11 in Compiler Preferences - generic (1d
    in parallel)

### Quick fixes

  - Convert 'var' into the resolved type
  - Convert type elided lambda param to var (what's the use anyway?)
    (3days for the above combined)

### Code templates

  - Use 'var' in templates for lambdas? - 3 days
