JDT stands for Java development tools, the sub-project of the
[Eclipse](Eclipse "wikilink") project that develops tools for
programming in Java. This includes a Java compiler, incremental builder,
editors, wizards, content assist, and all the other features of a first
class Java IDE. For more information, see the [JDT web
page](https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/).

The JDT subproject is broken down into components. Each component
operates like a project unto its own, with its own set of committers,
bug categories and mailing lists.

    infrastructure
